# LEAD-SCORING-CASE-STUDY
## OBJECTIVES
An instruction party chosen X Education sells connected to the internet courses to manufacturing artists. On some likely epoch, many specialists who are curious in the courses criticize strongly their site and peruse for courses. The party markets allure courses on various websites and search turbines like Google. Once these society criticize strongly the site, they power scan the courses or improve a form for the course or watch few videos. When these community add to a form providing their electronic mail address or phone number, they are top-secret expected a lead. Moreover, the party likewise gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are captured, workers from the transactions crew start making calls, essay emails, etc. Through this process, few of the leads catch convinced while most do not. The conventional lead adaptation rate at X instruction is about 30%. Now, even though X Education gets plenty leads, allure lead conversion rate is very weak. For example, if, reply, they gain 100 leads in moment of truth, only about 30 of bureaucracy are convinced. To create this process more adept, the party wishes to label ultimate potential leads, as known or named at another time or place ‘Hot Leads’. If they favorably recognize this set of leads, the lead adaptation rate concede possibility climb as the marketing team will immediately be directing upon corresponding accompanying the potential leads alternatively making calls to all.Build a logistic reversion model to designate a lead score middle from two points 0 and 100 for each of the leads that maybe secondhand apiece guest to mark potential leads. A taller score would mean that the lead is new, i.e. is seemingly to convert inasmuch as a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will generally not take convinced.There are few more questions bestowed for one guest that your model bear within financial means conform if the guest's necessity changes from now on so you will need to handle these also. These problems are determined in additional physician file. Please fill it established the logistic reversion model you infiltrated the beginning. Also, confirm you contain this in your definitive PPT place you'll create approvals.
